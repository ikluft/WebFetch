WebFetch To-Do/Wanted List
[updated 2022 after code modernization]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add a configuration infrastructure to the core WebFetch.pm which reads site defaults and configuration from
  one or more files
* Use the config files to add a feature which can schedule WebFetch modules with specific parameters to be
  launched at various times.
* Add docs for each WebFetch-derived module explaining better how to call it from within Perl.  (Current docs
  emphasize the command line because that's how it's been used.  But it isn't the only way to use it.)
* add more fetch modules:
  * calendar/upcoming events
  * watch for updates to any web page from a specified list
  * others as submitted by users (i.e. accessing various sites' REST APIs)
