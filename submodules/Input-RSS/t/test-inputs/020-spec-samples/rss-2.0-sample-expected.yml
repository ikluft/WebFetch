  - 'It''s been a few days since I added a song to the Grateful Dead channel. Now
    that there are all these new Radio users, many of whom are tuned into this channel
    (it''s #16 on the hotlist of upstreaming Radio users, there''s no way of knowing
    how many non-upstreaming users are subscribing, have to do something about this..).
    Anyway, tonight''s song is a live version of Weather Report Suite from Dick''s
